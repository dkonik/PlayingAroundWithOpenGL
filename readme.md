# README

Playing around with OpenGL to get an idea of how it works.

Heavily based of off [Yan Chernikov's](https://github.com/thecherno) OpenGL youtube series. Uses [GLM](https://github.com/g-truc/glm), [Dear ImGui](https://github.com/ocornut/imgui), and [stb_image](https://github.com/nothings/stb).
